# Welcome to Colyseus!

This project was created with [⚔️ `create-colyseus-app`](https://github.com/colyseus/create-colyseus-app/).

[Documentation](https://docs.colyseus.io/)

## :crossed_swords: Usage

```
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:2567 for the playground, or /monitor for the monitor.

## Structure

- `apps/backend/src/index.ts`: entry point — leave it alone if you plan to deploy to Colyseus Cloud
- `apps/backend/src/app.config.ts`: server configuration — rooms, HTTP routes, express middleware
- `apps/backend/src/rooms/MyRoom.ts`: your room handler
- `apps/backend/src/rooms/schema/MyRoomState.ts`: the state synchronized to every client in the room
- `apps/backend/test/MyRoom.test.ts`: boots the real server and connects a real client
- `apps/backend/loadtest/example.ts`: scriptable client for `npm run loadtest`
- `apps/backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`: pm2 configuration, used when deploying to Colyseus Cloud

## Scripts

- `npm start`: run the server in watch mode (`tsx watch src/index.ts`)
- `npm test`: run the mocha test suite
- `npm run build`: compile to `build/`
- `npm run loadtest`: connect N simulated clients with [`@colyseus/loadtest`](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-loadtest/)

## What's included

### Monorepo

Two packages that deploy independently: `apps/backend` (the Colyseus server) and
`apps/frontend` (a Vite app). The frontend imports the backend's *types* — not
its code — so `client.joinOrCreate("my_room")` is checked against the real room
definitions while the two still ship separately.

```bash
npm start                      # backend, on :2567
npm run dev -w apps/frontend   # frontend, on :3000 (second terminal)
```

`workspaces` is declared with plain `*` ranges, so npm, pnpm and yarn all
install it; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is there for pnpm's own resolver.

Pick this over the single Vite project when the two halves have different deploy
targets or release cadences. If they don't, the Vite layout is less to run.

### Fixed tick + client prediction

The room advances on `setFixedTimestep()`: a framework-owned accumulator runs
`step()` a whole number of times per frame, each advancing exactly `1/TICK_RATE`
seconds. A constant `dt` is what makes the client able to replay the same steps
— with `setTimestep()`'s measured delta it could not.

`defineInput(MoveInput, …)` gives each client a server-side input buffer.
`sanitize` clamps every field as it arrives, because nothing off the wire is
trustworthy. The input schema is deliberately flat and carries no `seq`, no `dt`
and no timestamp: the engine's own counter is the sequence, one input advances
exactly one step, and the SDK stamps lag-comp timing on the wire envelope.

`apps/backend/src/shared/movement.ts` holds the one function both sides run. It is typed
structurally so the same code steps a server Schema instance and the client
reconciler's plain predicted copy, and it is pure — no clocks, no randomness, no
reads outside its arguments. Keep it that way, or prediction and server will
disagree.

To add client-side prediction, see the client wiring in `apps/backend/src/client/` (generated
when the Vite layout is chosen) or the netcode guide:

### Lobby room

A `LobbyRoom` is registered as `lobby`, and the sample room is chained with
`.enableRealtimeListing()` so the lobby receives create/update/dispose events for
it. Clients join the lobby to render a live room browser:

```ts
const lobby = await client.joinOrCreate("lobby");
lobby.onMessage("rooms", (rooms) => { /* full list on join */ });
lobby.onMessage("+", ([roomId, room]) => { /* added or updated */ });
lobby.onMessage("-", (roomId) => { /* removed */ });
```

### Reconnection

`MyRoom.onDrop()` holds a dropped client's seat for 30 seconds via
`allowReconnection()`. The SDK retries automatically with exponential backoff;
`onReconnect()` fires if it gets back in time, `onLeave()` if it does not.
